# adhd-dashboard-manager

 1. **Define the Project Scope and Requirements**
   - Clearly outline the purpose of the app (e.g., an ADHD management dashboard).
   - List the key features you want to include (e.g., time tracking, task management, AI analysis, etc.).
   - Identify any third-party APIs you need to integrate (e.g., ManicTime, aimlapi.com, codehooks.io).

#### 2. **Choose the Tech Stack**
   - **Frontend**: React.js for building the user interface.
   - **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for handling API requests (if needed).
   - **Database**: Firebase or MongoDB for storing data.
   - **APIs**: ManicTime API, aimlapi.com API, codehooks.io API.
   - **Build Tools**: Webpack for bundling, Babel for transpiling.
   - **Version Control**: Git for version control.

#### 3. **Initialize the Project**
   - Create a new project directory.
   - Initialize a Git repository.
   - Set up the project structure with folders for components, services, and assets.

#### 4. **Set Up the Development Environment**
   - Install Node.js and npm.
   - Install React.js and create a new React app using `create-react-app`.
   - Install necessary dependencies (e.g., Axios for API requests, React Router for navigation).

#### 5. **Prompting GPT-Engineer**
   - **Initial Prompt**: Provide a high-level overview of the project and its key features.
     ```
     I want to build an ADHD management dashboard with the following features:
     - Time tracking using ManicTime API
     - Task management
     - AI analysis using aimlapi.com API
     - Serverless functions and database operations using codehooks.io API
     Please help me set up the initial project structure and integrate these features step by step.
     ```

#### 6. **Build the App Bit by Bit**
   - **Step 1: Create the Initial Layout**
     - Prompt GPT-Engineer to create the initial layout with placeholders for each feature.
     ```
     Create an initial layout for the ADHD management dashboard with sections for time tracking, task management, AI analysis, and serverless functions.
     ```
   - **Step 2: Integrate ManicTime API**
     - Prompt GPT-Engineer to integrate the ManicTime API for fetching user data and activities.
     ```
     Integrate the ManicTime API to fetch user data and activities. Display the data in the time tracking section.
     ```
   - **Step 3: Implement Task Management**
     - Prompt GPT-Engineer to create a task management system with CRUD operations.
     ```
     Implement a task management system with the ability to create, read, update, and delete tasks. Display the tasks in the task management section.
     ```
   - **Step 4: Integrate aimlapi.com API**
     - Prompt GPT-Engineer to integrate the aimlapi.com API for text analysis and image recognition.
     ```
     Integrate the aimlapi.com API for text analysis and image recognition. Display the results in the AI analysis section.
     ```
   - **Step 5: Integrate codehooks.io API**
     - Prompt GPT-Engineer to integrate the codehooks.io API for serverless functions and database operations.
     ```
     Integrate the codehooks.io API for creating serverless functions and performing database operations. Display the results in the serverless functions section.
     ```

#### 7. **Test and Debug**
   - Test each feature as it is implemented to ensure it works correctly.
   - Use browser developer tools to debug any issues.

#### 8. **Enhancements and Improvements**
   - **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure the app is mobile responsive using CSS media queries or a responsive framework like Bootstrap.
   - **Dark Mode**: Implement a dark mode toggle for better user experience.
   - **Error Handling**: Add error handling for API requests and user inputs.
   - **Loading States**: Add loading indicators for API requests.
   - **User Documentation**: Write detailed user documentation to guide users on how to use the app.
